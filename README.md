Design Patterns
====

This repo is for my design patterns prep. It uses easy to understand examples for each of the design patterns, most of which I found on the web and changed the implementation to help focus on the main concepts and to ease the prcoess of understanding. 

Each folder's `Driver.java` file contains the description of the design pattern. Each design pattern also has a `_UML.jpg` file for illustration purposes.
